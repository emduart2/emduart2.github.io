    I am a Junior Researcher at Centro de Matem&aacutetica Universidade do Porto in Porto, Portugal. My funding is provided by
    the Funda&ccedil&otilde para a Ci&ecircncia e a Tecnologia <a href= "https://www.fct.pt"> </a>  (FCT).
    Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher in the research training group <a href="https://www.mathcore.ovgu.de">MathCore</a> at Otto-von-Guericke Universit&aumlt Magdeburg
    and the<a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/nlalg/research.html">  Nonlinear Algebra group </a> at Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig.
	  I like to work on
Computational Algebra and  Geometry and Algebraic Statistics.  In May 2017 I obtained my PhD at University of Illinois Urbana - Champaign with
    <a href= "https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~schenck/ "> Hal Schenck</a>.</p>
  Checkout <a href = "https://tensorvoices.de">TensorVoices</a> a five episode podcast of conversations about tensors with enthusiastic guests. Hosted by <a href="https://thomas-kahle.de">
    Thomas Kahle and me.
