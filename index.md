Starting May 2023 I am an Assistant Professor of Probability and Statistics at the
[Departamento de Matemática, Universidade do Porto](https://www.cmup.pt). Previously my research was funded  by
the [Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia](https://www.fct.pt)   and I 
led the Research Group in Algebraic Statistics at  [Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de) in 
Leipzig. My research focuses on solving statistical problems using algebraic geometry, commutative
algebra and combinatorics.

## Recent Developments

* I am giving a talk  in the Probability and Statistics Seminar of [CEMAT](https://cemat.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/main.php) and [CEAUL](https://ceaul.org/o-centro/) at the Instituto Superior Têcnico, Universidade de Lisboa on November 22, 2023. [Slides Here.]({{ site.url }}/assets/RepresentationOfCICausalModels-Eliana.pdf)

* Our recent article [Learning linear Gaussian polytree models with interventions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299801) will appear in the Special Issue on Causality: Fundamental Limits and Applications of the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Information Theory.

* Our recent preprint [Algebraic Geometry of Quantum Graphical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11538) associates
algebraic varieties to quantum many-body systems defined by a graph. It is joint work with
[Dmitri Pavlov](https://dmmpavlov.github.io) and [Maximilian Wiesmann](https://maximilianwiesmann.github.io).

[comment]:# I'll be attending the Geometric Science of Information 2023 Conference August 30th to September 1st in St. Malo, France. The session I'm organizing is Computing Geometry and Algebraic Statistics.
