 Starting May 2023 I am an Assistant Professor of Probability and Statistics at the
[Departamento de Matemática, Universidade do Porto](https://www.cmup.pt). Previously my research was funded  by
the [Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia](https://www.fct.pt)   and I 
led the Research Group in Algebraic Statistics at  [Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de) in 
Leipzig. My research focuses on solving statistical problems using algebraic geometry, commutative
algebra and combinatorics.

## Recent Developments

* My joint [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09271) with [Liam Solus](https://people.kth.se/~solus/) was accepted for publication at the [Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb)

* This academic year I'm teaching Statistical Inference, Algebraic Geometry and
Estatística Aplicada.

* On Summer 2025, [Serkan Hosten](https://sites.google.com/view/serkanhostensfsu), [Simon Telen](https://simontelen.webnode.page/about-me/) and I organized a Summer school [New perspectives of discriminants and their applications](https://www.mis.mpg.de/events/series/slmath-summer-school-new-perspectives-on-discriminants-and-their-applications) at the MPI for Mathematics
in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany.

* I'll be gave a [tutorial](https://stagedtrees.github.io/events/trees4cat.html) about the algebra of staged trees at Genoa Oct 21-23, 2024.

* I'm a keynote speaker at the [Algebraic Statistics 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/algstat2025/program?authuser=0) conference in Munich.

[comment]:* I am giving a talk  in the Probability and Statistics Seminar of [CEMAT](https://cemat.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/main.php) and [CEAUL](https://ceaul.org/o-centro/) at the Instituto Superior Têcnico, Universidade de Lisboa on November 22, 2023.

[comment]:* Our recent article [Learning linear Gaussian polytree models with interventions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299801) will appear in the Special Issue on Causality: Fundamental Limits and Applications of the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Information Theory.

[comment]:* Our recent preprint [Algebraic Geometry of Quantum Graphical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11538) associates algebraic varieties to quantum many-body systems defined by a graph. It is joint work with [Dmitri Pavlov](https://dmmpavlov.github.io) and [Maximilian Wiesmann](https://maximilianwiesmann.github.io).

[comment]:# I'll be attending the Geometric Science of Information 2023 Conference August 30th to September 1st in St. Malo, France. The session I'm organizing is Computing Geometry and Algebraic Statistics.
