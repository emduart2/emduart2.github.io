Since January 2023 I will hold a joint appointment as Junior Researcher at [Centro de Matem&aacutetica Universidade do Porto](https://www.cmup.pt) in Portugal with funding provided by
    the [Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia](https://www.fct.pt)   and 
    lead the Research Group in Algebraic Statistics at  [Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de) in 
    Leipzig. My research focuses on solving statistical problems using algebra, geometry and combinatorics.
    Earlier, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the research training group[MathCore](https://www.mathcore.ovgu.de) at Otto-von-Guericke Universit&aumlt Magdeburg
    and the [Nonlinear Algebra Group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/nlalg/research.html") at Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig. In May 2017 I obtained my PhD at University of Illinois Urbana - Champaign with
    [Hal Schenck](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~hks0015/)
