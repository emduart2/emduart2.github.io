## Prospective Students
Are you interested in working on a project under my supervision? There are always projects for BSc, MSc, or PhD theses. Please talk to me if you are interested. Possible topics include
Algebraic Statistis: Graphical Models, Causality, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Models with Hidden Variables.
Applied Algebraic Geometry:
Geometric Modeling, Computer Algebra, Toric Varieties, Virtual Resolutions.
## Current Students
[Maximilian Wiesmann][def2] since December 2022.

## Mentoring
During my time as a postoc in at MathCore in Magdeburg I had the wonderful chance to be
be a mentor for: Tobias Boege, Alexandru Iosif, Christopher Borger, Ali Ardalani, Lamprini Ananiadi and Frank RÃ¶tger.
