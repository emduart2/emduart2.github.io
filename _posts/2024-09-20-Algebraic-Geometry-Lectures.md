## Homework Problems:
[Homework 1 - 08.10.2024 :](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vmgvbfgzhfbr#9b0adc)

## Taking notes:
A small part of the grade is based on note taking for a single class. You choose
which class you are going to take notes in. You communicate to me this choice either 
by email or in person, at least one day in advance.
You submit your notes up to 10 days later. Here is an overleaf template for the notes:

## End of semester presentations:
Each of you will choose a class of varieties from the list below and
do a 30 minute presentation to give the audience the definition of your
chosen variety and their many 
geometric and algebraic properties.
To learn about this varieties, first look for them in Joe Harris'
book "Introduction to Algebraic Geometry" where they appear frequently.
You may also want to consult other algebraic geometry books or notes.
Chose your variety by November 12th, 2024. Once you chose, tell me about
it. Two weeks before your presentation, send me an email with an
outline of the content of your presentation.
