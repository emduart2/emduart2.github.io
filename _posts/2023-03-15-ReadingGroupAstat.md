Organized by [Eliana Duarte](https://emduart2.github.io) and [Ben Hollering](https://sites.google.com/view/benhollering)
### Goals:
Algebraic Statistics  studies and solves of problems in Statistical Data Analysis using 
tools from Algebraic Geometry, Commutative Algebra, Discrete Geometry and, numerical and symbolic computation.
This is an active and exciting field of research that started almost three decades ago.
The goal of this reading course is, in the first part, to establish a common language for statistics and algebra; in the second part we will focus on more advanced topics and current
developments.

In the future months there will be many activities around Algebraic Statistics, these include
the [3-Way-Interaction-Seminar](https://3-way-interaction.de), several Minisymposia at the [SIAM AG23 Conference](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/ag23), and finally
the semester long program [Algebraic Statistics and Our Changing World](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/algebraic-statistics-and-our-changing-world/)
at IMSI. Participants in this reading group will be set up for an enriched experience in attending any of the aforementioned events.
### Format:
Each session is 90 minutes, split in two 35 minute blocks. Two people give talks
which they prepare together. We meet at 1:30pm on Thursdays excep on April 20th we meet at 2pm. Starting April 6th

### Dates:
1. April 6th, 2023. MPI-MIS. Room: G3-10. Algebra and Statistics Primer.  Karel Devriendt, Javier Sendra - 
 Ch.3 Algebra Primer, Ch.4. Conditional Independence, Ch.5 Statistics Primer
1. April 13th, 2023. MPI-MIS. Room: G3-10. Exponential Families a.k.a Toric Varieties. Leoni Kayser, Alexander Kreiss - 
Ch. 6 Exponential families a.k.a toric varieties
1. April 20th, 2023. E1 05 (Leibniz-Saal). Maximum Likelihood Geometry. Max Wiesmann, Dmitrii Pavlov - 
Ch.7 Likelihood Inference, Likelihood geometry, ML degree. We start at 2pm this day.
1. May 4th, 2023. MPI-MIS. Room: G3-10. Discrete Graphical Models. Tabea Krause, Lisa Seccia. Ch.13. Graphical Models
1. May 11th, 2023. MPI-MIS. Room: G3-10. Exercises - Questions- Clarification. The suggested exercises for this session are:
  Chap 4. 4.1, part 1, 4.7, 4.9, Chap 5. -5.1, 5.2, Ch 6. - 6.2, 6.4. Reading some proofs and presenting them is also useful for instance:
  The proof of Proposition 4.1.9 about conditional independence is a good exercise on marginal distributions of normal random variables ans Schur complements
