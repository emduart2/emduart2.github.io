title: "Reading Group In Algebraic Statistics"
date: 2023-03-15
---

## Goals:
Algebraic Statistics  studies and solves of problems in Statistical Data Analysis using 
tools from Algebraic Geometry, Commutative Algebra, Discrete Geometry and, numerical and symbolic computation.
This is an active and exciting field of research that started almost three decades ago.
The goal of this reading course is, in the first part, to establish a common language for statistics and algebra; in the second part we will focus on more advanced topics and current
developments.

In the future months there will be many activities around Algebraic Statistics, these include
the [3-Way-Interaction-Seminar](https://3-way-interaction.de), several Minisymposia at the [SIAM AG23 Conference](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/ag23), and finally
the semester long program [Algebraic Statistics and Our Changing World](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/algebraic-statistics-and-our-changing-world/)
at IMSI. Participants in this reading group will be set up for an enriched experience in attending any of the aforementioned events.
## Format:
Each session is 90 minutes, split in two 35 minute blocks. Two people give talks
which they prepare together. We meet at 2pm on Thursdays. Starting April 6th
